# Data Structure & Algorithms

This repo will be used to upload the `data structures` and `algorithms` encoutered chronologically in [CSC263H1](https://fas.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/CSC263H1).

*Note:* the textbook we are using is [[CLRS] Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein: Introduction to Algorithms (3rd ed).](http://labs.xjtudlc.com/labs/wldmt/reading%20list/books/Algorithms%20and%20optimization/Introduction%20to%20Algorithms.pdf)  

I will try to implement the algorithms using Golang. If not, will upload Python implementation instead.
